General Introduction

Traffic is something every one of us faces in daily life.
We would try todifferent driving behaviors and simulate the traffic dynamics of a two lane model and implement.



Fundamental Questions

Develop an efficient model by studying the resources.
Compare the behavior with existing two lane models.
Study the propagation of traffic jams when one of the lanes is jammed due to an accident.
Find optimal distance between cars which leads to better traffic flow 
Try to study the effect of a single "rogue" driver on the whole system.


Expected Results

Propagation of jam  through traffic should behave like the propagation of a wave  that is the jam should propagate in the direction opposite to the travel direction.

Higher gap between the cars  should lead to better resolution of traffic jams.
